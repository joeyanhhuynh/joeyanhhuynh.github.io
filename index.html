                My name is Joey Anh Huynh; I am a pasionate third year graphic design student from Algonquin College. I
                started to work as freelancer after first year and I recognized that graphic design is not only my
                passion,
                It also helped me discover myself. In fact, I know why I want to be a graphic designer. Because I feel
                happy
                when I see people happy with my designs, and when they satisfied with my designs. It means I can help
                clients to achieve their goals.In addition, graphic design trains my personalities such as It makes me
                to be
                more confident and more patient. I take responsibility with each designs and with my clents. It doesn’t
                matter how much the clients pay for each project, I still try the best I can.

                        <h2>GANGNAM STYLE</h2>
                        I used Lobato Design to create Psy who is very famous with Gangnam Style. I did learn how to
                        design it from Pablo Lobato who born in Trelew, Patagonia Argentina in 1970, is a graphic
                        designer and illustrator.
                        In 1982 he drew his first portrait, an illustration of Cesar Luis Menotti, the coach of the
                        national soccer team at that moment. Everybody seemed to like it, so Pablo decided that this was
                        his thing. But he did not want to be a painter, he admired the artist Uderzo, not Cezanne, as
                        Fine Arts was too much, but graphic design could be a good choice to keep on drawing while
                        paying the bills.

                        Diary of Mommy is a song which is telling the
                        mother’s feeling about her child. Sittnce she
                        hatttd pregnancy, then her baby came out; the
                        baby grew up and left her; finally she still waits
                        for her child coming back. My design bases on
                        the meaning and the tone of this song.

                        used feather to present the meaning of this business.
                        Green is color of trust and confidentiality, tact and diplomacy.

                        <h2>TEAVANA PACKAGE DESIGN</h2>
                        I design Oolong package of Teavana company which
                        three flavors: Strawberry Rose, Toasted Nut Brulee,
                        and Wild Orangte. My first package is tea box cover;
                        the second package is tea tag.
                        I create Oolong logo by brushing the name on the paper; then I used Adobe Photoshop to fix it. I
                        mix Canadian style and Asian style to create this package. Moreover, I used gold color which
                        make it to be more high class.

                        I love this quote, so I make a decision to create a quote poster. I used negative space to
                        create a shape of the woman who is wearing a beautiful hat. In addition, I create a shape of a
                        man's face on her hat which is presented for the meaning of the quote.
